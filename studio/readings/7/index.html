            <h1>Reading 7 - THE MEME</h1>


            <p>Memes spread faster than the plague, and they have become a part of almost every culture. While they are very diverse in content, meaning, and target audience, they all relate to a cultural aspect or trend that is somehow relatable to its audience.  </p>

            <p>Every country has its own take on memes, making them adaptable to all culture groups and sense of humor. </p>
