            <p>I think it is very true when she says that it is important for people to make their own websites, as opposed to using a platform like facebook or instagram to showcase their work. When we are constrained to the limitations of a platform like facebook, we dont have much freedom as deigners to make it our own. By coding we have so much more freeedom to execute vitrually any design.</p>
