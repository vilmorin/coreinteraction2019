            <p>As a designer, I have learned the importance of making several variations for a single design. By doing so, you give yourself the time to explore different approaches for the same content, and decide which is the most succesful one, or more appropriete one. </p>

            <p>Style is the way in which content is being presented. As graphic designers it is argualbly the most significant thing we are tasked to find. </p>
