            <h1>Reading 8 - A NOTE ON THE TIME</h1>


            <p>The article brings up the concept of time in ways that we dont tend to think about. Often we forget that time is something that we humans invented as a mesurment, but it is not as linear as we think.</p>

            <p>If time can only be measured by movement, how can it be documented in unconventional ways?</p>
