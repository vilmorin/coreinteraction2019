            <h1>Reading 5 - A Handmade Web</h1>


            <p>I agree that smaller handheld devices have affected the handmade web. While accesing websites in any devices is evidently important, I believe that a website is not fully experienced in mobile, as opossed to a computer.</p>

            <p>Maybe in the future we will have a completly redesigned medium in which to surf the web in a mor unified format.</p>
