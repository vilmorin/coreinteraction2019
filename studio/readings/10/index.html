            <h1>Reading 10 - Typeface as Programme</h1>


            <p>Technology has a huge influence in the way typography has been mainuplated and used throughout history. And in today's digital world everyone has access to thousands of typefaces that can be easily printed or displayed digitally. This also means that anyone anywhere can create any typeface without any previous experience or education. Which can be both good and bad. </p>

            <p>The value of an experienced graphic designer/type designer today, is often ignored or disregarded by the eyes of many who do not have experience in the field. </p>
